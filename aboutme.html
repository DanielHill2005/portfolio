    <p>Awards and Achievements</p>     
    <section class="content"><p>I am not super good at keeping track of what awards I have but I know that I’ve<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1"> gotten Honor Roll a couple of times. I take classes like AP Calculus AB and next year I’ll be taking 4 AP classes. The highest GPA I’ve gotten is 4.5 in the first semester of my junior year in high school. Other than the academic awards I also have CIW certification in JavaScript. I was one of the three in the class to actually pass the test.</span></p></section>

    <p>Hobbies</p>          
    <section class='content'><p>Like I said before, I am a huge nerd. I really like anything fantasy or<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2"> sci-fi. I like video games, movies, and books. I’m also into tech stuff like VR and I built my own computer. I am very passionate about D&D and I have recently gotten into Warhammer. Not only are these fun games, but they give me an awesome creative outlet in painting minis. Or “models” if it's Warhammer. I don’t live my entire life with fantasy escapism though. I make sure to spend a good amount of time going to the gym and hanging out with friends. </span></p></section>

    <p>Post Secondary Plan</p>           
    <section class="content"><p>For college I am debating on whether to go to community college or just to go straight<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3"> to a 4 year. I really want to graduate with as little debt as possible because I have heard about how student loans can last your entire life. I haven’t decided on what college I want to go to yet, but I know I’ll be going to one in California. After that depends on what happens in college. Hopefully I have made some connections but if not I’ll need to just find a job some other way.</span></p></section>
