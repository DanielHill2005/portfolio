    <h2>Ready Player One Essay</h2>
    <p class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can a player take the Oasis too far?<br>
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the book Ready Player One, Ernest Cline writes about a virtual world, called the Oasis, where people can have completely separate identities from their real one. The Oasis is like a massive MMO with tons of things to do and lots of cool social features, but it should be enjoyed in moderation. This world where people can be perfect and flawless can actively hinder a person’s life where it really matters. The character, Art3mis, is a great example of this. She is someone that gets false confidence through the Oasis, only to push people away once they get close. Constant Oasis use has made her self-confidence in real life drop extremely low. These examples show how something like the Oasis would turn a lot of people into social recluses who never grow in real life. 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the freedom people have with their avatar in the Oasis, they can be whatever they want. They can get rid of their flaws and become the perfect human. They don’t even have to be human. This obviously makes them more confident, which can make them more charismatic and natural in the Oasis. At first this seems good, but it’s not real confidence. They can go around being perfect for a while, but as soon as they take off the headset they will feel worse than before. Art3mis comes off as very confident early in the book. She is very charismatic when she has the cover of the Oasis. When Wade and Art3mis first meet, she acts confident and natural. She is this way because she feels safe in the Oasis. But even when she’s still friends with Wade she lies to him about her real self. In a chat log she told him that she has brunette hair and blue eyes, when in reality she has the same eye and hair color as her avatar. This is because she’s ashamed of the differences there are between her real self and her avatar. “Parzival: Fine. What color is your hair? IRL? Art3mis: Brunette. Parzival: Eyes? Art3mis: Blue” (Cline 173). But later on when Wade sees her real face in a picture he thinks, “To my surprise, she looked almost identical to her avatar. The same dark hair, the same hazel eyes…” (Cline 391). These two excerpts show that Art3mis is willing to lie about herself in real life because she is scared people will know more about her real self. Even if the details about her hair and eye color are small, they are still lies. Someone could argue that it’s just to protect her identity from online people, but she wouldn’t make her avatar almost identical to herself if she wanted that. Instead she made her avatar look very close to her real self only to lie to someone who wants to get closer to her.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way the Oasis actively hinders someone’s growth is making them scared to have actual connections in real life. Spending so much time online where you have a level of protection from your actions will definitely change how you see relationships in real life. The way that this affects Art3mis is how she pushes people away when they get closer to her. Readers don’t learn much about her activities in real life, but they can see how it affects her relationships in the Oasis. She is very confident and friendly with people she doesn’t know but gets scared when they get to know her better. If someone she’s talking to gets too close she will withdraw and run away. She doesn’t want the people she meets to get closer to her in real life. One example of this is how she stops talking to Wade after he tells her he loves her. To be fair, Wade was being a creep, but she didn’t have a problem with that until he got too close to her real life identity. She starts insisting that Wade doesn’t actually know her and talks about how she’s deformed and ugly. During the argument Art3mis tells him, “‘You aren’t in love with me, Z,’... ‘You don’t even know me’” (Cline 186). Even though the two characters have been talking and hanging out for months, Art3mis says that Wade doesn’t know her. In this falling out they were both in the wrong. Wade was treating this like he was getting broken up with when they were never together, but Art3mis is justifying herself in an unhealthy way. She is calling their relationship fake and demeaning herself. The things she is saying aren’t true and are harmful to both Wade and herself. She wouldn’t feel these things if this was just a normal relationship, not one that came out of the Oasis.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oasis is great at making people feel extremely bad about themselves physically. It gives people a bad expectation of what people should be like. Since in the Oasis everyone can be unnaturally perfect, if people can’t live up to that they get very self-conscious about their flaws. Art3mis constantly tells Wade that she is ugly and unlovable in real life. She says that it’s better for him to think of her as a monster. All of this is because she has a birthmark on her face. When Wade sees this it doesn’t bother him at all, in a way it makes him like her more. She doesn’t believe him when he calls her beautiful. She even avoids him all the way up until the last few pages of the book, even right before saying that he is her favorite person. During their falling out at the party Art3mis says, “‘Trust me. If I ever let you see me in person, you would be repulsed’” (Cline 186). But then later we can see how Wade reacts, “Art3mis had led me to believe that in reality she was somehow hideous, but now I saw that nothing could have been further from the truth” (Cline 292). This shows how little Wade cares about something that Art3mis is so worried about. The time in the Oasis that she spent without the birthmark skewed how she saw herself with it. She hates herself so much she would go so far as to call herself repulsive. Even without the Oasis, most people would be self conscious about a birthmark like that, but Art3mis might not have been so self-deprecating if she wasn’t in the Oasis most of the time.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Oasis is something that has lots of awesome features, but only if used in moderation. Like any good thing, there’s a point where use of it becomes too much. Addiction to it can lead to the active destruction of your identity in real life. Art3mis is a character that demonstrates this perfectly. Constant Oasis use has caused her to be very confident in the Oasis, but not very confident in real life. She also becomes scared of having actual connections with people in real life. The biggest thing that happens is she becomes super self conscious about her body and looks. All of this makes her someone that talks to people easily but starts pushing them away once they get too close. It’s like the opposite of the average person. Overall, the Oasis has affected her real life identity in a negative way.

    <h2>A Sound of Thunder Essay</h2>
    <p class="content">	
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the story, “A Sound of Thunder,” by Ray Bradbury, there is a small but colorful cast of characters. One of the most interesting of these characters is Travis. Travis is the guide on the expedition. The reader can tell by how he acts that he is very confident because of doing this so many times. Bradbury wrote, "’Some dinosaurs have two brains, one in  the head, another far down the spinal column. We stay away from those. That's stretching luck. Put your first two shots into the eyes, if you can, blind them, and go back into the brain.’" The way he so matter-of-factly explains how to kill a dinosaur proves how competent he is. He shows a darker side to his personality when he forces Eckels to get the bullets as a punishment. Bradbury describes Eckels after the punishment: “He returned, shuddering, five minutes later, his arms soaked and red to the elbows.” The character, Travis from “A Sound of Thunder,” is a very capable person but he has a dark side to his personality that makes him a little bit ruthless. This ruthlessness drives how the story changes after the attack.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of a Time Safari, Inc like from Ray Bradbury’s, “A Sound of Thunder,” is very dangerous and is better off not being so accessible at such a relatively small price. It’s way too easy for someone to accidentally drastically change the future. Bradbury shows this in the line, “The stomp of your foot, on one mouse, could start an earthquake, the effects of which could shake our earth and destinies down through  Time, to their very foundations.” He spends a 
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lot of time talking about how drastically things can change. Another problem is the huge danger that hunting beasts from another time represents. A dinosaur is an almost alien threat to people from our time. The way Eckels first reacts shows this: “‘It can't be killed,’ Eckels pronounced this verdict quietly, as if there could be no argument.” A monster like that isn’t meant to come into contact with humans. While the idea of a time travelling hunt safari service sounds cool, in real life the implications of such a thing would be terrible.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story, “A Sound of Thunder,” by Ray Bradbury uses a presidential election as one of the differences between the world before and after time travel shenanigans. Before the main characters set off on their adventure the candidate, Keith, wins the election, but after, the other candidate, Deutscher, wins instead. Bradbury only really describes Deutscher, he’s an, “anti everything man for you, a militarist, anti­Christ, anti­ human, anti­-intellectual.” The characters seem to imply that America would have become more of a dictatorship under Deutscher. From that the reader can infer that Keith represents ideologies and policies that are the opposite of that. In the post time travel future Keith is described: “Not that fool weakling Keith. We got an iron man now, a man with guts!” This shows that Keith is probably less of a flashy politician and does things in a more calculated manner. Stepping on one butterfly has the power to change how one election goes, which can end up changing the path a whole country goes down.
