    <h3>Chronoshift Expeditions</h3>
    <section class="card">

      <p>The first website we ever made was a fictional tourism company website. This website was based off of Ray Bradbury’s science fiction story, “A Sound of Thunder.” We had to wireframe and prototype with Figma for the first time. It was also our first time using HTML and CSS in a big project.<br> 
        We started off with getting all the HTML on there and then trying to clean up the mess with CSS. Doing all of the HTML was of course easy, but there were some times I had to go back and change it to make the CSS easier. I noticed after the first page was completely done after what felt like forever, the next four pages all went by super fast. I think I just got into the groove of CSS. <br>       
        The hardest part was matching the final product to the Figma prototype. When we made our prototype we had no idea what was possible with our skills in HTML and CSS. So some details and features on the prototype ended up being extremely hard to pull off. This was reflected in our next project where the prototypes became way more achievable with our current skills in programming.<br>    
        For this project I learned how valuable it is to start a project the right way. Because of not being able to support the ambitious prototype with my skill level I was feeling discouraged. Of course I still finished the project but it felt like I let my original vision down. CART’s Habit of Mind, “Initiate” is all about going forward with an idea but I think it’s important to make sure you are starting the right way. It’s good to know your limits and plan something that you are capable of achieving.<br>

    <h3>Tourism Website</h3>
    <section class="card">
      <img>
      <p>The final project of the first semester was a group project with two other students. We were tasked with making a tourism website about three countries of our choice. I chose Norway because it seems like a really nice place to visit. Each of us had to research our own country to get information about the culture, traveling, and prices. We used Figma to wireframe and prototype the website and HTML and CSS to code the website.<br>
        I got lucky with my team because we never had any issues with each other. If someone was slacking off, the others on the team could push them to get to without any hard feelings. Some of our peers called us the “power couple” of the class because we would get ahead and plan out everything down to the last detail. <br>
        I’m very proud of the finished product. I think that there’s some bad design choices, like the navigation, but other than that everything looks good. We didn’t have to make any compromises. The final product looks like what we planned. The biggest headache was making the mobile media query, but now it works really well. The best feeling was when some of our media queries worked themselves out because of the way we did the HTML and CSS. All we had to do was change the width of the screen and most things resized perfectly.<br>
        I think that my team and I saw a lot of success because of our ability to work together. This taught me how important CART’s Habit of Mind, “Communicate,” is. We probably would have struggled a lot more, but we were constantly making sure everything was going along smoothly. For example, we never had any merge conflicts on GitHub. Since we communicated correctly, we got through that website without any problems.<br>

    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <section class="card">
      <img>
      <p>For most of the second semester we have been learning JavaScript. We use a CIW JavaScript course and the book “Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd Edition: A Modern Introduction to Programming.” I have some experience with coding languages such as C# and Blockly so I already knew a lot of the information in the beginning of both courses. <br>
        On the CIW course we have quizzes to take for each lesson. At the end of each Eloquent JS chapter we do a worksheet on the content of the chapter. The quizzes and worksheets sometimes got tough, but there were enough tools to get us through it. <br>
        The hardest part of JavaScript for me is using abstract code. The more complex code is just harder for me to learn and understand. I have just tried to slowly introduce myself to the higher level code. Of course when I’m trying to find a solution for a problem I’m having I can look for the easy basic solution, but I always try to understand the higher level solutions.<br>
        Learning JavaScript definitely took a lot of perseverance. Learning JavaScript is perfect for the CART Habit of Mind, “Persistence.” It’s tough, but it’s definitely rewarding. It feels very good to fix one problem and watch everything start to work. I love the feeling of seeing a finished product after working on it for so long.<br>

    <h3>Interactive Story</h3>
    <section class="card">
      <img>
      <p>The project that I am most proud of is definitely the interactive story project. With one partner, we wrote our own story and then made a Choose Your Own Adventure game around it. We used a small amount of HTML and CSS because there actually wasn’t much on the page. It was mostly JavaScript, by a large margin. <br>
        My partner and I got super ambitious, and for the most part we succeeded. Our story takes place in a distant future where humanity has conquered the entire Milky Way galaxy. The main character discovers a map that leads to the galaxy’s last great secret. The twist is that the map leads to a planet whose star is at the end of its life span. The player has a set amount of choices they can make before the star supernovas and kills the player. This plot point is heavily inspired by the game Outer Wilds.<br>
        Working on the project took about 2 months. We started with just writing the story which took a long time. Like I said before, me and my partner got super ambitious. We wrote over 14 thousand words. There are a lot of variables to keep track of, like who you have with you, and what information you have. This was all handled with a really big JavaScript function.<br>
        One idea from our ambitious plan that we had to cut was having dynamic images. We wanted there to be an image that set the stage for where you were in the story. For example if the player is in a space bar it should put an image of a space bar, but if the player moves to a jungle planet, it should put an image of a planet. We did not have time to implement this. It took CART’s Habit of Mind, “Reflect,” to realize that. We had to really think about how this feature we had planned was impossible to make. I believe that the project would have overwhelmed us if we hadn’t reflected and made the smart decision to cut it.<br>
